# metreon
Metreon is a statically typed Domain Specific Language (DSL) that aims to verify execution contexts, effects, ownership, resource lifecycles, and asynchronous protocol topology in low-level GPU pipelines

## Run the frontend examples

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/contexts.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/resources.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/accumulators.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/kernel_variables.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/procedures.mtr
```

The current compiler parses and validates `.mtr` context declarations and
resource state machines, kernels, and procedures, then emits textual GraphIR
with context metadata, resource graphs, and ordered callable bodies. Procedures
support typed parameters and return types, resource-transition calls, nested
blocks, and execution-context/effect requirements. See
[procedure syntax and validation](docs/procedures.md) for the supported forms
and limits. It does not yet generate or execute runtime or GPU code.
